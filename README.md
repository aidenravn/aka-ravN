👤 About Tayfun

Hi, I’m Tayfun.
I’m a builder working at the intersection of AI and Web3, developing open-source systems that make contributions, privacy, and intelligence verifiable on-chain.
My work focuses on cryptographic trust, user sovereignty, and protocol-level UX — building primitives that let people coordinate, prove value, and stay secure without centralized intermediaries.
